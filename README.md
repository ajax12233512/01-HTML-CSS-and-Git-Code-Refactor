# 01-HTML-CSS-and-Git-Code-Refactor
First Homework
This is a code refactor. I started by inserting semantic html elements where it would be easiest read the code. 
I then added the img alt attributes so that they were descriptive to what was contained inside of them. 
In order to maintain the layout of the website, I moved the css selectors from the <div> elements and inserted them into the semantics.
I further commented the code so readabliity would be easier for other developers. 
I noticed that one of the links didn't properly navigate to its respective part of the page because it was missing an ID attribute. A quick id insertion solves it.
